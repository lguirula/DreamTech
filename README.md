## Inputs

Since JSON is a data-only format, it doesnâ€™t support comments. The turnaround was to put the comments as pseudo data, starting their names with underscores. That way, we can have easy access to the different options of a parameter.

```json
{
    "data_label_1": [],
    "data_label_2": ""
}
```
